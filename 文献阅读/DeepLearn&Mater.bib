  abstract = {A data-driven analysis of lithium-ion battery electrode materials using unique visualization methods to explore correlations not seen in single material publications.           ,              In this work we present a data-driven approach to the rational design of battery materials based on both resource and performance considerations. A large database of Li-ion battery material has been created by abstracting information from over 200 publications. The database consists of over 16\,000 data points from various classes of materials. In addition to reference information, key parameters and variables determining the performance of batteries were collected. This work also includes resource considerations such as crustal abundance and the Herfindahl–Hirschman index, a commonly used measure of market concentration. The data is organized into a free web-based resource where battery researchers can employ a unique visualization method to plot database parameters against one another. This contribution is concerned with cathode and anode electrode materials. Cathode materials are mostly based on an intercalation mechanism, while anode materials are primarily based on conversion and alloying. Results indicate that cathode materials follow a common trend consistent with their crystal structure. On the other hand anode materials display similar behavior, based on elemental composition. Of particular interest is that high energy cathodes are scarcer than high power materials and high performance anode materials are less available. More sustainable materials for both electrodes based on alternative compositions are identified.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Predicting the properties of materials prior to their synthesis is of great importance in materials science. Magnetic and superconducting materials exhibit a number of unique properties that make them useful in a wide variety of applications, including solid oxide fuel cells, solid-state refrigerants, photon detectors and metrology devices. In all these applications, phase transitions play an important role in determining the feasibility of the materials in question. Here, we present a pipeline for fully integrating data extracted from the scientific literature into machine-learning tools for property prediction and materials discovery. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning techniques, we successfully reconstruct the phase diagrams of well-known magnetic and superconducting compounds, and demonstrate that it is possible to predict the phase-transition temperatures of compounds not present in the database. We provide the tool as an online open-source platform, forming the basis for further research into magnetic and superconducting materials discovery for potential device applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A database of battery materials is presented which comprises a total of 292,313 data records, with 214,617 unique chemical-property data relations between 17,354 unique chemicals and up to five material properties: capacity, voltage, conductivity, Coulombic efficiency and energy. 117,403 data are multivariate on a property where it is the dependent variable in part of a data series. The database was auto-generated by mining text from 229,061 academic papers using the chemistry-aware natural language processing toolkit, ChemDataExtractor version 1.5, which was modified for the specific domain of batteries. The collected data can be used as a representative overview of battery material information that is contained within text of scientific papers. Public availability of these data will also enable battery materials design and prediction via data-science methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first auto-generated database of battery materials extracted from a relatively large number of scientific papers. We also provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to aid the use of this database.},
