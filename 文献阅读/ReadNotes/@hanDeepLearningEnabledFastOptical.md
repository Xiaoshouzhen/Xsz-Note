## Abstract
“Advanced microscopy and/or spectroscopy tools play indispensable role in nanoscience and nanotechnology research, as it provides rich information about the growth mechanism, chemical compositions, crystallography, and other important physical and chemical properties. However, the interpretation of imaging data heavily relies on the “intuition” of experienced researchers. As a result, many of the deep graphical features obtained through these tools are often unused because of difficulties in processing the data and finding the correlations. Such challenges can be well addressed by deep learning 1, 2, 3, 4” ([Han 等。, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/UB8EIPLP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SD7ADTUP?page=2&annotation=23TBPXW5))
